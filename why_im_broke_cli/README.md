# WhyImBrokeCli

Welcome to my first project.  This gem scrapes a site that has a whole bunch of different activities to do in NYC.  Users can select an activity to get more information about it.  Pretty straight forward.  Hope you like it =)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'why_im_broke_cli'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install why_im_broke_cli

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
